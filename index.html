					<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
					<p>I am very interested in expanding my knowledge of Artificial Intelligence. During my Computer Science degree I gained a First in the course on AI, where I had to pre-process data for different Machine Learning implementations and adjust parameters in order to produce useful classifiers (Weka). Outside of University I have taught myself Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks and backpropagation, and naively implemented an ANN with backpropagation in Java, which was an interesting project. That project is available on <a href="https://GitHub.com/ApexNadir">my GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/ApexNadir/NeuralNetworkSVM_Naive">here</a>, amongst other projects.</p>
