					<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
					<p>I am very interested in expanding my knowledge of Artificial Intelligence. In university I did a course on AI, where I had to pre process data for different Machine Learning implementations and adjust parameters in order to produce useful classifiers. Since then I have self taught myself Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks and backpropagation, and naively implemented it myself in Java, which was an interesting project. That project is available on <a href="https://GitHub.com/ApexNadir">my GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/ApexNadir/NeuralNetworkSVM_Naive">here</a>, amongst other projects.</p>
